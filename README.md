# Crystal Game


* This is an interactive game for web browsers to test their mathematic skills. This application uses updated **HTML** along with **jQuery Library** to create a guessing game.

* **Here's how the app works:**

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

* When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
